                        <h2>Formal Education</h2>
                        <p>DAVID CALVO has dedicated his professional life to the art of woodcarving and sculpture. In 1974, he started college as a psychology major, but soon realized the professors had the problems they were talking about. So after one year, he changed his major to philosophy because he found it to be a more broader, more all-encompassing topic. The teachers seemed more happy too. He graduated with a degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1979.</p>
                        <p>In 1993, after being in the sculpture and woodcarving field for fourteen years he returned to Graduate School at Boston University. He was accepted into the Divinity School. David used it as an opportunity to study and focus on how ancient civilizations used symbols as a organizing force for the individual as they related to themselves, to each other as a community, and to the forces of nature that played out around them without insulation.</p>

                        <h2>Traditional Old-World Wood Carving and Sculpture Training</h2>
                        <p>Calvo has always worked with his hands as long as he can remember. It was during his college years that he borrowed a set of carving tools from his best friend's family and started carving to balance out the headiness of a philosophy curriculum. After graduating college, he had his heart set on seeing if woodcarving could possibly be a profession. He landed his first job at an established sign carving studio in Boston. He was encouraged to find a place near the studio to lay his head at night cuz the training might take him into the evenings. By good fortune or the fate of the Gods, he found himself able to live with his cousin "who happened to lived right next door" to the carving studio. On his first day of work, he rolled out of bed, walked next door and started his wood carving training with woodcarver Paul Sales.</p>
                        <p>David Calvo was also trained at Casieri DiBiccari Studio in Boston where he assisted both principle artists. Archangelo Casceri was a skilled woodcarver who trained and worked with the late Kirschmeyer, who migrated from Germany and became the starlet of Boston carvers. In his early years Archangelo trained with Italian Sculptor Ernest Pelligrini, who was the chief artist/sculptor for "Irving and Casson", a manufacturing plant for church statuary and carved interior furnishing in the Boston area. Adio diDiccari, his partner was a natural sculptor who modeled in clay and whose sculpture work was cast into all sorts of mediums. Adio went to the MFA Museum School in Boston and studied under Frederick Allen who was the School Director. Allen saw Adio's natural talent and trained him as his protege. He also had Adio assist him at his personal studio at 27 Tavern Rd across from the Museum of Fine Arts. Allen eventually sold his Italian renasiance sculpture studio, a converted horse barn, to Adio who continued the legacy and lead a team of artist to create sculpture work for churches and public setting across the States. He was like a second father to me and my hands do as he taught them.</p>
                        <p>David also trained with German carver Frederic Brunner, who went through the European apprenticeship program before immigrating to the States in the Boston area. Frederick Brunner not only was a skilled artist and carver, but he also forged all his own tools as well. David then went on to work with woodcarver Jimmy Lohmann whom Frederick Brunner connected the two because he saw a mutual natural talent for handling carving chisels. All said, for anyone as fortunate as Calvo... to be trained under this caliber of mentorship is absolute pedigree training.</p>
                        <p>In addition to his artistic skills, David has extensive training and experience in building high-end custom furniture making him a well-rounded artist and craftsman. He worked for Joseph Van Benton Custom Furniture in Boston where contemporay furniture was made with solid traditional construction techniques. He also worked with Mario Genovese, high-end custom furniture maker in Natick. And to complete his studies, David traveled solo throughout Europe exploring and studying artistic woodcarving and sculptural designs in different cultures to expand his visual dictionary.</p>

                        <h2>Passing on the Carving Tradition</h2>
                        <p>David has been a featured master woodcarver at many International Woodworking Trade Shows where he has given woodcarving workshops on woodcarving technique and designing skills. He has also been a featured TV guest on the PBS Television shows: "The Woodwright's Shop" with Roy Underhill and "The American Woodshop" with Scott Phillips.</p>
                        <p>In addition to running a full time studio, David has a wood carving school and writes articles for national publications to promote and share his skill. He has also recently produced a three-part wood carving instruction video series (not for sale yet) on the most important aspects of wood carving to train the beginner and intermediate student. David is a sought-after teacher because his unique training is a rarity. He is also a natural speaker who has the ability to articulate the mechanics of the skill of wood carving in an easily understood fashion.</p>
